# COMP 3020 Group 7  
## U of M Bisons Social Hub 🦬

This project is our **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** group assignment for **COMP 3020** at the University of Manitoba.  
We’re developing a prototype web app called **“U of M Bisons Hub”**, designed to help students explore campus events, view them on an interactive calendar, and access event details easily.

The prototype currently includes three main pages:

- 🏠 **Home Page:** Overview and navigation to featured events.  
- 📅 **Calendar Page:** Interactive calendar for browsing upcoming events.  
- 🎟️ **Event Page:** Displays full details for selected event.

### 🚧 Pages Not Implemented  
As part of the prototype scope, the following pages were **designed but not implemented**:

- 🎉 **Social Events Page** — Not Implemented; currently displays a “Page under development” message.  
- 🏀 **Clubs & Organizations Page** — Not implemented; currently displays a “Page under development” message.

Each implemented page is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with development done on separate branches for clear organization and collaboration.
