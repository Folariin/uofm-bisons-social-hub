# COMP 3020 Group 7
## U of M Bisons Social Hub 🦬

This project is our **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** group assignment for **COMP 3020** at the University of Manitoba.  
We’re developing a prototype web app called **“U of M Bisons Social Hub”**, designed to help students explore campus events, view them on a calendar, and access event details easily.

The prototype includes three main pages:
- 🏠 **Home Page:** Overview and navigation to featured events.
- 📅 **Calendar Page:** Interactive calendar for browsing upcoming events.
- 🎟️ **Event Page:** Displays details for selected events.

Each page is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and developed on its own branch for easier collaboration.
